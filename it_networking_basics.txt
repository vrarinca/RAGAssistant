Networking Basics Overview

Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices so they can communicate and share resources. A network allows systems to exchange data, access shared services, and coordinate tasks.

Types of Networks

A Local Area Network (LAN) connects devices within a limited geographic area such as an office, home, or building. LANs typically use Ethernet or Wi-Fi technologies.

A Wide Area Network (WAN) spans large geographic areas, often connecting multiple LANs. The internet is the largest example of a WAN.

A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) covers a city or large campus and sits between LAN and WAN in scale.

Network Devices

A router connects different networks together and forwards data packets based on IP addresses. Routers often provide internet access and network segmentation.

A switch connects devices within the same network and uses MAC addresses to forward traffic efficiently.

A firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules to protect systems from unauthorized access.

An access point allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi.

IP Addressing

An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers written in dotted decimal format, such as 192.168.1.1.

IPv6 addresses are 128-bit and were introduced to address IPv4 exhaustion.

Protocols

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data delivery.

UDP is a connectionless protocol optimized for speed and low latency.

HTTP and HTTPS are application-layer protocols used for web communication.

DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

Network Security Concepts

Encryption protects data confidentiality during transmission.

Authentication verifies the identity of users or systems.

Authorization determines what actions an authenticated entity is allowed to perform.

Firewalls and intrusion detection systems are commonly used to secure networks.

Common Troubleshooting Steps

Check physical connections and link lights.

Verify IP configuration and network settings.

Test connectivity using tools like ping and traceroute.

Review firewall rules and security policies.

Summary

Understanding basic networking concepts is essential for IT operations, cybersecurity, and system design. Networks rely on standardized protocols and devices to provide reliable communication between systems.
